Hi there! 

I am Roelof Blommaert, nice (as you might have read from my username). I'll keep the intro kind of short.

I am currently studying Marketing Management but I’’d like to soon study Data Science & Marketing Analytics at ESE (Econ faculty). Really looking forward to this course, specifically working with the API :)
